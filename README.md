ü©∏ Blood Bank Management System
Project Overview
The Blood Bank Management System is a comprehensive full-stack application built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It's designed to streamline and automate the operations of a blood bank, efficiently managing donor information, blood inventory, recipient requests, and overall blood donation processes, ensuring the timely availability of blood and ultimately saving lives.

This system aims to reduce manual effort, improve data accuracy, and provide a centralized, modern, and intuitive platform for managing critical blood bank operations.

‚ú® Features
Donor Management:
Register and manage donor profiles (personal details, blood group, contact info, medical history, last donation date).
Search and filter donors based on blood group, location, last donation date, etc.
Blood Inventory Management:
Track available blood units by blood group, component (e.g., Whole Blood, Plasma, Platelets), and expiry date.
Record incoming donations and outgoing issuances.
Automated alerts for low stock or expiring units to facilitate timely action.
Recipient Management:
Register and manage patient/recipient profiles.
Process blood requests and intelligently match with available inventory.
Donation Camps/Drives:
Schedule and manage blood donation camps, recording attendees and collected units.
User Authentication & Authorization:
Secure user registration and login functionality.
Role-based access control (e.g., Admin, Staff) to different functionalities.
Reporting & Analytics:
Generate various reports on donation history, current blood stock levels, and demand trends.
Visualize statistical insights on blood group availability and usage.
Intuitive UI/UX: A responsive and user-friendly interface for seamless interaction.
RESTful API: Robust backend API for efficient data handling.
üöÄ Technologies Used
This project leverages the power of the MERN stack:

Frontend:
React.js: A declarative, component-based JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Redux (Optional/If used): For predictable state management.
React Router: For declarative routing.
Axios: For making HTTP requests to the backend.
CSS Framework/Library: [e.g., Bootstrap, Material-UI, Tailwind CSS, or custom CSS]
Backend:
Node.js: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
Express.js: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
Mongoose: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
JWT (JSON Web Tokens): For secure user authentication.
Bcrypt.js: For password hashing.
Database:
MongoDB: A NoSQL database that provides high performance, high availability, and easy scalability.
